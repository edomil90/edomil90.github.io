## Professor (PI)

### Prof. Dr. Edoardo Milana

I hold a BSc (2012) in Mechanical Engineering and a MSc (2015) in Nanotechnology Engineering both from the University of Rome La Sapienza and a PhD (2020) in Engineering Science from KU Leuven, advised by Prof. Dominiek Reynaerts, Prof. Michael De Volder and Prof. Benjamin Gorissen. In 2019 I was Visiting Researcher at the Interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence for Nanostructured Materials and Interfaces of the University of Milan, under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Milani. From 2020 to 2022 I was Research Scientist at the Institute for the Protection of Terrestrial Infrastructure of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). In 2023 I moved to the Freiburg Center for Interactive Materials and Bioinspired Technologies thanks to the DFG Walter Benjamin Programme. In the same year I started as Assistant Professor of Soft Machines at the Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK) and the DFG Cluster of Excellence livMaTs.
