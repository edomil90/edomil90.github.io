I was born in Rome, Italy, on the 22th of October 1990. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master’s degree in Nanotechnology
Engineering both from the University of Rome La Sapienza (Italy) and I received my PhD in Engineering Science in 2020 from KU Leuven (Belgium).

My research focusses on the design and manufacturing of bioinspired soft robotic systems and soft actuators at different scales. I am active in the fields of Soft Machines, Microengineering and Embodied Artificial Intelligence. I have published 17 papers on refereed journals and proceedings of international conferences. I serve as Review Editor for the journal Frontiers in Robotics and AI and I have reviewed papers for the journals Soft Robotics, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Ocean Engineering and international conferences IEEE RoboSoft and IEEE ICRA.

I have received the Best communication paper award at IEEE RoboSoft 2021. I have been recipient of an FWO (Flemish Research Foundation) grant for a three-months visiting stay at the University of Milan. I have been selected for the Freiburg Rising Stars Academy 2021/2022.
