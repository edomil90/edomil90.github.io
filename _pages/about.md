My research focusses on the design and manufacturing of bioinspired soft robotic systems that can intelligently interact with the environment at different scales thanks to their mechanical properties. This Embodied Intelligence is implemented via multifunctional materials and structures with distributed actuation, sensing, control and energy. My fields of interest are Robotics, Biomimetics, Nanotechnology and Mechanical Engineering.

I am currently Postodoctoral Research Associate at [FIT - Freiburg Center for Interactive Materials and Bioinspired Technologies](https://www.fit.uni-freiburg.de/) and Associated Scientist at the DFG Cluster of Excellence [livMatS](https://www.livmats.uni-freiburg.de/en/people/associated-scientists/dr-edoardo-milana). I am also affiliated to the [Soft Robotics Group](https://www.softroboticsgroup.com) of Prof. Benjamin Gorissen at KU Leuven.
