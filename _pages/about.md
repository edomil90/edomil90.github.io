Our research focusses on the design and manufacturing of bioinspired soft robotic systems that can intelligently interact with the environment at different scales thanks to their mechanical properties. This Embodied Intelligence is implemented via multifunctional materials and structures with distributed actuation, sensing, control and energy. Our fields of interest are Robotics, Biomimetics, Nanotechnology and Mechanical Engineering.

We are part of the [Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK)](https://www.imtek.de/) at the University of Freiburg and of the DFG Cluster of Excellence [livMatS](https://www.livmats.uni-freiburg.de). Our labs are  at [FIT - Freiburg Center for Interactive Materials and Bioinspired Technologies](https://www.fit.uni-freiburg.de/).
